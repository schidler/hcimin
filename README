======

This binary includes some tools from the bluez stack that allow configuration
and usage of bluetooth dongles as beacons. It is a striped down version of
commands from hcitool, hciconfig and bdaddr. The following commands are
currently supported (this is subject to change):

 * reset:   Reset HCI device
 * vreset:  Reset HCI device using vendor specific commands
 * up:      Open and initialize HCI device
 * down:    Close HCI device
 * addr:    Try setting devices MAC address (device dependent)
 * cmd:     Send command to HCI device (params are hex)
 * scan:    Passively scan for bluetooth beacons in the vincinity

In particular the scan command is subject to change and/or be extended. Right
now the utitlity is designed to configure and show bluetooth devices beaconing
in the vincinity (i.e. iBeacon).

It also allows temporarily changing the MAC of bluetooth devices (till the
next power cycle).
